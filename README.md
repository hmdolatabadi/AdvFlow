# AdvFlow

This repository is the official implementation of [_AdvFlow: Inconspicuous Black-box Adversarial Attacks using Normalizing Flows_]().
A small part of this work, the Greedy AdvFlow, has been published in [ICML Workshop on Invertible Neural Networks, Normalizing Flows, and Explicit Likelihood Models](https://invertibleworkshop.github.io/accepted_papers/pdfs/36.pdf).

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training Normalizing Flows

To train the a flow-based model, first set `mode = 'pre_training'`, and specify all relevant variables in `config.py`. Once specified, run this command:

```train
python train.py
```

## Attack Evaluation

To perform AdvFlow black-box adversarial attack, first set the `mode = 'attack'` in `config.py`.
Also, specify the dataset, target model architecture and path by setting the `dataset`, `target_arch`, 
and `target_weight_path` variables in `config.py`, respectively. Once specified, run:

```eval
python attack.py
```

for CIFAR-10, SVHN, and CelebA. For ImageNet, however, you need to run:

```eval
python attack_imagenet.py
```

Finally, you can run the Greedy AdvFlow by:

```eval
python attack_greedy.py
```

## Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained flow-based models as well as some target classifiers can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18J8eh-KLaPq9vUe_TwhuQMBW4WKBVX0L/view?usp=sharing).

## Results

### Fooling Adversarial Example Detectors

The primary assumption of adversarial example detectors is that the adversaries come from a different distribution than the data.
Here, we attack the CIFAR-10 and SVHN classifiers of the powerful [Mahalanobis adversarial detector](https://github.com/pokaxpoka/deep_Mahalanobis_detector), and show that the adversaries generated by our model can mislead them more than the similar method of NATTACK. This suggests that we were able to come with adversaries that have similar distribution to the data.

| Dataset                    | CIFAR-10           | SVHN              |
|----------------------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Attack                     | NATTACK  | AdvFlow | NATTACK | AdvFlow |
| Detection Rate (AUROC (%)) | 97.95    | 66.87   | 72.85   | 64.36   |
